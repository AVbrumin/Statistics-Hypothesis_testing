## Testing statistical hypotheses

This is the third project in my portfolio.

In this project I tested statistical hypotheses based on two samples containing information on mortality from diseases of the cardiovascular system in the countries of the world in 2014 and 2015.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate mastery of the following skills and tools:
- construction of confidence intervals of different types;
- use of various statistical criteria (parametric, non-parametric, goodness-of-fit, bootstrap) to test hypotheses;
- Python (SciPy, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
